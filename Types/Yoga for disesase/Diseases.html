      <h1>Yoga For Diseases</h1>
      <div class="Information">
        <h3>What is Yoga For disease</h3>
        <p>Yoga has been the subject of research in the past few decades for therapeutic purposes for modern epidemic
          diseases like mental stress, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive
          pulmonary disease. Individual studies report beneficial effect of yoga in these conditions, indicating that it can
          be used as nonpharmaceutical measure or complement to drug therapy for treatment of these conditions. However,
          these studies have used only yoga asana, pranayama, and/ or short periods of meditation for therapeutic purposes.
          General perception about yoga is also the same, which is not correct. Yoga in fact means union of individual
          consciousness with the supreme consciousness. It involves eight rungs or limbs of yoga, which include yama,
          niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. Intense practice of these leads to
          self-realization, which is the primary goal of yoga. An analytical look at the rungs and the goal of yoga shows
          that it is a holistic way of life leading to a state of complete physical, social, mental, and spiritual
          well-being and harmony with nature. This is in contrast to purely economic and material developmental goal of
          modern civilization, which has brought social unrest and ecological devastation.

            <p>Overweight and obesity are strong risk factors for diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. Yoga
              has
              been found to be helpful in the management of obesity. Training of yoga asnas and pranayama for three
              continuous
              months, 1 h every day in the morning by a yoga expert resulted in decrease in body weight, body mass index

                Sukha pranayama at the rate of 6 breaths/min

              be
              due to a normalization of autonomic cardiovascular rhythms as a result of increased vagal modulation and/or

            <p>India is referred to as diabetic capital of the world as it has the largest number of cases of diabetes. The
              practice of yoga asanas and pranayama helps in control of type II diabetes mellitus and can serve as an adjunct to
              medical therapy.Training of yoga asanas and pranayama for three continuous months, 1 h every day in the morning by a yoga expert
              resulted in decrease in fasting as well as postprandial blood glucose levels and acetylated hemoglobin.

                In another study from India, yoga asanas and pranayama after 40 days of practice brought down fasting as well as
              postprandial blood glucose levels and acetylated hemoglobin in patients of non — insulin-dependent diabetes
              mellitus. They developed a sense of well-being within 10 days and there was a lowering of anti-diabetic drugs.
              Yoga also has a beneficial effect on cognitive brain functions and thus can be incorporated along with the
              conventional medical therapy for improving cognitive brain functions in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

              lesions
              and in improving myocardial perfusion, which was translated into clinical benefits and symptomatic improvement.

              Having flat feet, also known as flatfoot, is a condition where one or both feet have little to no arch. When you
              stand, the pads of the feet press into the ground. Typically, you can’t see an arch in the foot, though sometimes
              the
              arch appears when you lift the foot.
              All babies have flat feet at birth. Arches typically form by age 6. About two out of 10 children still have flat
              feet
              as adults. Some adults have arches that collapse. This condition, fallen arches, is another term for flatfoot.
              Flat feet aren’t a problem for most people. If flat feet cause pain or other problems, treatments can help.
